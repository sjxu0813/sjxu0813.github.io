<p style="font-size:0.7em;text-align:justify !important;text-justify:inter-word;">My research interests center on humans’ adaptive behavior in an uncertain world. Specifically, I am curious about how people infer contextual information to optimize their control strategies in response to changing demands. My approach combines behavioral experiments, neuroimaging techniques, and computational modeling.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.7em;text-align:justify !important;text-justify:inter-word;">I earned my bachelor’s degree in psychology at East China Normal University in China. I then completed a master’s degree in cognitive neuroscience at the University of York in the UK, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/izumalab/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Keise Izuma</a>. I did my research intership in <a href="https://erlichlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Jeffrey Erlich </a>'s lab at NYU Shanghai in China. I later carried out my doctoral research with <a href="https://users.ugent.be/~sbraem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Senne Braem</a> and <a href="https://www.cogcomneurosci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Tom Verguts</a> at Ghent University in Belgium.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.7em;text-align:justify !important;text-justify:inter-word;">I will soon start my postdoctoral work at the University of Würzburg in Germany, working with <a href="https://www.garvertlab.com/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Mona Garvert</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.7em;text-align:justify !important;text-justify:inter-word;">In my spare time, you may find me on the basketball court, or simply lying in bed.</p>
