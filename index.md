<span style="font-size:0.7em;text-align:justify !important;text-justify:inter-word;">My research interests center on humans’ adaptive behavior in an uncertain world. Specifically, I am curious about how people infer contextual information to optimize their control strategies in response to changing demands. My approach combines behavioral experiments, neuroimaging techniques, and computational modeling.</span>

<span style="font-size:0.7em;text-align:justify !important;text-justify:inter-word;">I earned my bachelor’s degree in psychology at East China Normal University in China. I then completed a master’s degree in cognitive neuroscience at the University of York in the UK, under the supervision of [Prof. Keise Izuma](https://sites.google.com/view/izumalab/home). I did my research intership in [Prof. Jeffrey Erlich](https://erlichlab.org/)'s lab at NYU Shanghai in China. I later carried out my doctoral research with [Prof. Senne Braem](https://users.ugent.be/~sbraem/) and [Prof. Tom Verguts](https://www.cogcomneurosci.com/) at Ghent University in Belgium.</span>

<span style="font-size:0.7em;text-align:justify !important;text-justify:inter-word;">I will soon start my postdoctoral work at the University of Würzburg in Germany, working with [Prof. Mona Garvert](https://www.garvertlab.com/start).</span>
